Playground to make and break a Votable app

**Rails 4.2.3**

### Current Status

Current implementation:
Sand pit to make and break a small Votalbe app. Decided to BDD Devise as a
refresher on using minitest --spec.  Built Article Model and Controller
with a focus on TDD and minimal Views to get the test to pass.
TDD Act-As-Votable gem without using Views.
